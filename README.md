# Introduction
**Testcase Generator** is a handy tool for preparing the input and output dataset for programming problem. Input generator is implemented using [CodeForces](https://www.codeforces.com/) [testlib.h](https://codeforces.com/testlib) library in C++. This tool is specially helpful for the problem author and tester of a programming competition.

# Features
* ## Input Generator
    Most of the programming problems contain a large number of input dataset. Solver's source code runs against these input dataset and provides verdict accordingly. So it's important to prepare valid testcases. But it's not easy to generate a large number of handmade testcases. This is where Input Generator comes into the picture. It generates specified number of testcase files in just a few seconds.
* ## Output Generator
    For every programming problem there are some input dataset and corresponding output dataset. That means a solver's souce code will be considered correct if the source code runs against the input dataset and produces output exactly same as the judge output dataset. So judge output should be accurate. Output Generator runs the judge solution executable(.exe) against the input dataset and prepare output dataset accordingly in just a few seconds.
